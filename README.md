## 🎲 Trivia Game
This is a trivia game that I made in Python with a command line interface. It allows the user to pick from three different topics to be quizzed on. Once a topic is chosen the user will be asked a question and four answers will be provided for each question. The user can then enter numbers 1-4 to select an answer for the question. If the user enters the correct answer then they are asked the next question but if they are incorrect they will be asked if they want to try again. If the user is able to answer all five questions correctly for that secific topic then they win the trivia game.
## ✨ Technologies
- Python
- CLI (Command Line Interface)
- User input
## 🚀 Features
- Multiple choices
- Topic selection
- Loops for more attempts
## 📌 The Reason
I created this trivia game for my Python class final project to showcase what I had learned about Python during the length of the class. The main goals that I had in mind for this Python application when I was working on it was to allow user input, use variables, include multiple functions, include if/else statements as well as loops, and use a list to remember username.
